# FreakWAN and a MicroPython SX1276 driver

This repository is a work in progress for the following two projects that are going to live in the same place:

* An SX1276 driver written in MicroPython, for devices like the LYLIGO TTGO LoRa v2 1.6 and similar.
* A simple WAN system using LoRa devices, called FreakWAN, part of the [FreakNet](https://www.freaknet.org/) project.

The driver itself is already usable, and the `example.py` file shows how to work with it. Soon this README will be populated with all the documentation both for the driver and for the FreakWAN, but for now all is in its initial stage.
