This is a quick hack to have a Serial BTE CLI that works on MacOS without
installing any library, only using core stuff. Just reads from the standard
input and writes to the BTE device, and returns what the BTE device sends.

Sorry about the Objective-C part. The code is terrible as I'm not an
Objective-C programmer. But there is no CoreBluetooth lower-level C API
so I had to find my way among the Apple stuff.
